\index{brute force}
Find the unique positive integer whose square has the form $1\_2\_3\_4\_5\_6\_7\_8\_9\_0$,
where each '''\_' is a single digit.

\section*{Solution}

I'm not very happy with my solution here, but here it is. The first thing to notice is that we are looking for 9 digits between $[0,9]$, making $10^9$ possible combinations. Now, the number we are looking must have 10 digits and has the form:

$$
d_0d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5d_6d_7d_8d_9.
$$

We know that $d_9^2$ must ends with $0$. So the only choice is that

$$
d_9 = 0
$$

Also we know that 

$$
d_8^2 + d_7d_9 = 9
$$

Replacing $d_9$ with 0 we obtain

$$
d_8^2 = 9
$$

We have two solutions here, $d_8$ can be 3, or 7. What I did was to try both numbers, and give $d_7$ different values.\\

With the values of $d_7,d_8$, and $d_9$, we can find the the other seven digits by brute force in a reasonable amount of time.
