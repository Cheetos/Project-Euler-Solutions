Consider the divisors of $30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30$.
It can be seen that for every divisor $d$ of $30$, $d+30/d$ is prime\\.

Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ not exceeding $100000000$
such that for every divisor $d$ of $n$, $d+n/d$ is prime.

\section*{Solution}

The sequences for the first ten numbers are the following:

\begin{align*}
    2 &: 3,3\\
    3 &: 4,4\\
    4 &: 5,4,5\\
    5 &: 6,6\\
    6 &: 7,5,5,7\\
    7 &: 8,8\\
    8 &: 9,6,6,9\\
    9 &: 10,6,10\\
    10 &: 11,7,7,11
\end{align*}

Is easy to notice that the first element in the sequence is $n+1$, then $n+1$ must be prime. Then the integers we are looking are even, since $n+1$ must be prime, and all prime numbers except $2$ are odd.\\

So far we know that we are looking for even numbers, and since all even numbers have $2$ as a divisor, then $n/2+2$ must be prime as well. Then we are looking even numbers such as, $n+1$ is prime and $n/2 + 2$ is prime.\\

I found out (by try and error) that these integers, except $2$ and $6$ ,are of the form of $10 + 20a, 18+20b$, and $22+20c$, for $a,b,c \geq 0$.  Now, not every number is valid, so we must check if all divisors $d$ of those numbers meet that $d + n/d$ is prime. From sequences above we can notice the sequences are mirrored from half, then we only need to search for divisors up to $\sqrt{n}$, which will run a lot faster.
